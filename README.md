# The-Bank
A C# Banking Application

SeeSharpBank is the name of the application. There are two services in the main project, AccountService and BankService.
Most of the time here was spent on the Account aspect because the rules were much more robust.
The bank service allows you to Get Banks and Add Accounts
The Account Service allows you to perform transactions on accounts.

To see the executed code run the test project: SeeSharpBank.Tests
The tests include some unit tests that will test the basic functionality for banks and accounts
The account tests have additional scenarios to test simulated transactions
